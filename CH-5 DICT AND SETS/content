  d={}  #empty dictionary
  
marks={
    "harry":100,
    "shubham":50,

to create empty set
#to create an empty set
s=set()
print(type(s))
#sets are used becoz its takes every input only once.no repetition of elements allowed.
print(s)
a={1,2,4,5,6} #sets are same as dictionary in representation
print(len(a))
a.remove(1) #to remove an element from the set
a.pop() #removes a random element from the set
print(a)
a.clear() #to clear the set
#SET UNION FUNCTION- used to join two sets
p={1,2,3,4}
q={3,4,5,6}
print(p.union(q))
print(p.intersection(q)) #used to give the common values between the two sets
