LISTS AND TUPLES
lists are used to store variable data types and unlike strings lists are immutatble(changes can occur in lists)


guy=("harry")
guy[2]="c"
print(guy)

THIS CODE WILL GIVE ERROR IN ASSIGNING VALUES BECOZ STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE  
  
guy=["harry","rohan"]
guy[0]="m"
print(guy)
THIS CODE WILL WORK BECOZ LISTS ARE MUTABLE AND SQAURE BRACKETS ARE USED FOR LISTS

 l1= [10,20,30,40,50]
print(l1.append("mannat"))#adds element to the end of the list
l1.insert(index,item to be inserted)  #adds the new item at that index in the list 

FOR A LIST WHICH CONTAINS ALL INTEGER VALUES AND NO STRINGS WE CAN ALSO USE SORT FUNCTION
l1.sort()  #arranges all the elements(integer values) in the list in ascending order
l1.reverse()  #reverses the order of the elements of the list

TUPLES
tuples are immutable and can't be changed.tuples are also enclosed in brackets and separated by commas.

a=(1)
print(type(a))
#returns output as int

a=(1,)
print(type(a))
#returns output as tuple

#SPLICING OF TUPLE
my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5,6)
slice=my_tuple[1:4]   #splicing of tuple from index 1 to index 4(excludong index 4)
print(slice)
